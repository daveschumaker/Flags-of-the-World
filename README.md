# Flags of the World Quiz

You can see it in action, right here: [http://app.dave.ly/flags/](http://app.dave.ly/flags/)

I've been playing around with Angular JS this weekend and built this simple web app using AngularJS and Node to quiz users on random flags of the world. Work in progress.

**Note:** This doesn't have all the flags in the world, yet. But hey, maybe you'll learn something while you play with it! :)

To use:

```
npm install
```

```
bower install
```
